## Architecture Highlights

### Server-Authoritative Multiplayer
```
Client (60 FPS) → Input → Server (20 Hz tick) → Physics → Snapshot → All Clients
                          ↓
                    Anti-cheat validation
                          ↓
                    Database persistence
```

**Why this matters:**
- **No cheating**: Server owns the truth
- **Fair gameplay**: Everyone sees the same state
- **Smooth feel**: Client prediction hides latency

### Game Loop
```typescript
// Client
requestAnimationFrame → Input → Predict → Render → Send to Server

// Server
setInterval(50ms) → Read Inputs → Simulate Physics → Broadcast State
```

### Data Flow
```
User Types Email → Magic Link → JWT → WebSocket → Match Room → Game State
                                                        ↓
                                                   Database
```

## Common Tasks

### Development
```bash

pnpm test             # Run tests
pnpm lint             # Check code
pnpm format           # Format code
pnpm check:setup      # Verify setup
```

### Database
```bash
pnpm db:migrate       # Run migrations
pnpm db:seed          # Seed data
pnpm db:studio        # Open GUI
pnpm db:reset         # Reset (dangerous!)
```

### Deployment
```bash
pnpm build            # Build all
docker build          # Build images
railway up            # Deploy
```

## Customization Ideas

### Easy (< 1 hour)
- Change colors/theme
- Add new cosmetics
- Adjust game constants
- Add new obstacle types
- Modify scoring rules

### Medium (1-4 hours)
- Add new game modes
- Create power-ups
- Add sound effects
- Implement achievements
- Add chat system

### Hard (1+ days)
- Add Redis scaling
- Implement replays
- Add spectator mode
- Build mobile app
- Create tournament system

## Troubleshooting

### Setup Issues
```bash
# Run this first
pnpm check:setup

# Common fixes
pnpm clean && pnpm install
pnpm generate:keys
pnpm db:reset
```

### Development Issues
```bash
# Rebuild shared package
pnpm --filter @skipay/shared build

# Regenerate Prisma
cd apps/server && pnpm prisma generate

# Clear cache
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
```

### Production Issues
```bash
# Check logs
railway logs

# Check health
curl https://your-server.railway.app/healthz

# Restart service
railway restart
```

## Performance Tips

### Client
- Keep frame rate at 60 FPS
- Avoid creating objects in game loop
- Use object pooling for particles
- Optimize Canvas rendering

### Server
- Keep tick rate at 20 Hz
- Use database indexes
- Cache leaderboards
- Limit WebSocket message size

### Database
- Use connection pooling
- Index foreign keys
- Regular VACUUM (PostgreSQL)
- Monitor slow queries

## Security Checklist

- ✅ Never commit `.env` files
- ✅ Never commit `*.pem` key files
- ✅ Use strong JWT keys (2048+ bit)
- ✅ Rotate keys periodically
- ✅ Use HTTPS/WSS in production
- ✅ Enable Railway firewall
- ✅ Use Neon IP allowlist
- ✅ Monitor for abuse
- ✅ Rate limit all endpoints
- ✅ Validate all inputs

## Scaling Strategy

### Current (v1)
- Single server instance
- In-memory match state
- Good for ~100 concurrent players
- Vertical scaling (bigger server)

### Future (v2)
- Multiple server instances
- Redis for shared state
- Load balancer with sticky sessions
- Horizontal scaling
- Good for 1000+ players
